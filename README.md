# Chatnix

Chatnix is a simple chatroom server powered by [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/). It serves as a backend to any client that speaks HTTP and Websocket.

To start the Chatnix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
